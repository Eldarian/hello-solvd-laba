Lesson 7 - lists

1. ArrayList used in data/Database.java (foreach in getRestaurantNames(), findRestaurant()), city/Restaurant, city/Street.
   LinkedList used in staff/Manager

2. Map used in data/Database.java (Map<String, Street> streets, map foreach in getStreetNames()).

3. Fixed: null operator case in Client.contactOperator(), connection attempts are limited. Package system has been improved.
